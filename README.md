# 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python' - practice projects
## Overview
What is this repository for? This is a simple place for me to store my Python practice projects from https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ by Al Sweigart. This repository is more like a portfolio. The projects are sorted by their corresponding chapters in the book, with Chapter 7 being the first in this repository. For all of the projects I use Python 3 with Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
## What should you do with the projects?
Most of the projects are very simple (so far) so simply copy and paste the code into your preferred IDE or code editor which supports Python 3. Some of the programs do utilise external modules so do remember to install it before importing.
